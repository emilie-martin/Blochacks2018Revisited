# Blochacks2018 Revisited
>   Original: 2018 | Revisited: 2019

As the name implies, this is v2.0 of the project we did for the Blochacks2018 hackathon.

The goal was to help facilite the creation of a CV, mostly for newly arriving immigrants, but also simply for a student in need of a CV template for their first job application.
